  - `.restart()` - restart counting,
  - `.addIntervals()` - add a new interval result,
  - `.clearIntervals()` - clear all intervals.
- own styling,
- JSX syntax.

## Getting Started

- [View project online](https://szympol.github.io/19.7_Stopwatch_ReactJS/)

Please follow instructions below, if you are willing to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Both [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) are required to run this project locally.

### Installing

Please copy and paste below commands to your Git terminal step by step to get a development env running.

Download a repository:

```node
git clone git@github.com:szympol/19.7_Stopwatch_ReactJS.git stopwatch
```

Go to the project working directory:

```node
cd stopwatch
```

Install all of the dependencies with the following command:

```node
npm install
```

View the project

```node
npm run watch
```

#### Under the hood of `npm run watch`

This command deploys the project to the live stream on `http://localhost:3000` and watches any changes in `*.html script.js *.css`. Once a change detected, the browser reloads. Moreover, when `script.js` experiences any changes, Babel compiles this file to browser-compatible version of JavaScript `script-compiled.js`.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
